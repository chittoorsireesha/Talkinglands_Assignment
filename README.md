# Task-3 : Prometheus and Grafana
      we had a separate monitoring and observability team that handled Prometheus, Grafana, and other monitoring tools.While I haven’t worked hands-on with them directly, I’m familiar with how they’re used in DevOps workflows — like visualizing metrics, setting up alerts, and monitoring infrastructure health.I’m definitely open to learning and working with them if needed, as I understand their importance in production environments.

# Task-4 :
I’m still improving my Python skills, so I leveraged ChatGPT to assist with the script for Task 4. It helped me understand the structure, error handling, and how multipart uploads work.I believe using such tools is valuable when you're learning and want to get things done efficiently. I reviewed the code thoroughly and made sure I understood how it works.I'm continuing to practice Python so I can write more scripts independently going forward.
